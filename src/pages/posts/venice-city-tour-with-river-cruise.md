  <span class="md-first-letter">V</span>enice’s magic is best discovered from the water. Cruising its canals reveals layers of history, romance, and art that make it one of the world’s most enchanting cities.

<p class="md-paragraph">
  The tour begins near <b>Piazza San Marco</b>, where gondolas and vaporettos weave past palaces and bridges. From the Grand Canal, you’ll see the stunning facades of Venetian Gothic architecture — each one a reflection of centuries of trade and culture.
