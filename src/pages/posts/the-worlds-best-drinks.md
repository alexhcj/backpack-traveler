<p class="md-paragraph">
  <span class="md-first-letter">B</span>razil’s flavors are bold, bright, and refreshing. Beyond coffee and Caipirinhas, the country offers an endless variety of drinks that reflect its tropical soul — full of rhythm, color, and sunshine in every glass.
</p>

<div class="md-space-md"></div>

<p class="md-excerpt">Here are five iconic drinks that capture Brazil’s spirit — from beachside bars to rainforest farms.</p>

<div class="md-space-lg"></div>

<h4 class="md-list-title">1. Caipirinha – The National Cocktail</h4>
<p class="md-paragraph">
  Made with <b>cachaça</b> (a sugarcane spirit), lime, sugar, and ice, the Caipirinha is Brazil’s signature cocktail. It’s refreshing, tangy, and deceptively strong — the perfect companion for sunset on Copacabana Beach.
</p>

<h4 class="md-list-title">2. Guaraná – The Energy of the Amazon</h4>
<p class="md-paragraph">
  A sweet, lightly carbonated drink made from the <b>guaraná berry</b> native to the Amazon rainforest. Packed with natural caffeine, it’s a symbol of Brazilian vitality and found everywhere — from street stalls to football matches.

<h4 class="md-list-title">3. Açaí Smoothie – The Purple Powerhouse</h4>
<p class="md-paragraph">
  The frozen pulp of the Amazonian <b>açaí berry</b> has become a global trend, but its roots are deeply Brazilian. Blended into thick smoothies or served in bowls with banana and granola, it’s a healthy favorite in Rio’s beach cafés.

<h4 class="md-list-title">4. Coconut Water – Straight from the Source</h4>
<p class="md-paragraph">
  In Brazil, coconut water isn’t bottled — it’s cracked open fresh. Street vendors slice the top of a green coconut, hand you a straw, and let you sip the purest tropical refreshment straight from nature.
</p>

<h4 class="md-list-title">5. Café Brasileiro – The Morning Ritual</h4>
<p class="md-paragraph">
  Coffee is part of Brazilian identity. Locals drink it strong and sweet — a quick <b>“cafezinho”</b> shared between friends or during business meetings. Brazil is the world’s largest coffee producer, and its aroma fills every city corner.

  “In Brazil, drinks aren’t just refreshments — they’re a celebration of life, rhythm, and connection.”

<p class="md-paragraph">
  Whether you’re sipping a Caipirinha by the sea or sharing a coffee in a bustling São Paulo café, Brazil’s drink culture tells a story — one of joy, community, and the endless taste of summer.
