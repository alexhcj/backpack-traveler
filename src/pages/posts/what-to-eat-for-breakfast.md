  <span class="md-first-letter">B</span>reakfast in London is both tradition and trend. Whether you start your morning with a classic English fry-up, a croissant in a Notting Hill café, or a vegan bowl in Shoreditch — the city celebrates the first meal of the day in every possible way.

<h4 class="md-section-title">The Classic English Breakfast</h4>
<p class="md-paragraph">
  Known simply as the <b>“Full English”</b>, this hearty meal includes eggs, bacon, sausages, baked beans, grilled tomatoes, mushrooms, and toast — often served with tea or coffee. It’s a breakfast born from Britain’s working-class history and still a staple in cafés across the UK.
</p>

<p class="md-paragraph">
  Local favorite spots include <b>The Breakfast Club</b> in Soho and <b>Regency Café</b> near Westminster — the latter known for its retro interior and appearances in British films.

<h4 class="md-section-title">Modern Morning Trends</h4>
<p class="md-paragraph">
  London’s food scene has evolved into a playground for creative breakfasts. Avocado toast, shakshuka, and matcha lattes have become staples in trendy cafés. Visit <b>Dishoom</b> for its Bombay-style breakfast — bacon naan rolls and house chai are must-tries.

<h4 class="md-section-title">Healthy & On-the-Go Options</h4>
<p class="md-paragraph">
  For those in a rush, smoothie bars and bakeries make mornings easier. Grab a granola pot or a sourdough pastry from <b>Gail’s Bakery</b> or <b>Pret a Manger</b>. You’ll find Londoners sipping oat lattes as they walk to work — a modern ritual that keeps the city moving.

<h4 class="md-section-title">Cultural Twists on Breakfast</h4>
<p class="md-paragraph">
  London’s diversity means you can start your day with flavors from around the world — Turkish menemen in Dalston, Japanese-style pancakes in Soho, or Caribbean saltfish and ackee in Brixton. Each borough offers a breakfast adventure of its own.
</p>

<p class="md-excerpt">
  “Breakfast isn’t just a meal — it’s how London wakes up, one neighborhood at a time.”
