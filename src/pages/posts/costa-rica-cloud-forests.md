  <span class="md-first-letter">T</span>he first morning I woke up in Costa Rica’s cloud forests, the air felt different — cooler, heavier, alive. Mist drifted between towering trees, blurring the line between earth and sky. It was quiet in a way cities never are, broken only by distant bird calls and the soft drip of condensation falling from leaves above.
</p>
<p class="md-paragraph">
  Walking the forest trails felt like moving through another world. Every step revealed something new: moss-covered branches, flashes of bright feathers, the sudden rustle of unseen movement. Time slowed here. There was no rush, no checklist — just the rhythm of walking and observing.
</p>

<div class="md-space-lg"></div>
<ul class="md-list col-1">
  <li class="md-list-item">Crossing a suspension bridge as fog rolled in, briefly hiding the forest below.</li>
  <li class="md-list-item">Spotting a resplendent quetzal perched silently among the branches.</li>
  <li class="md-list-item">Listening to the forest wake up at dawn — birds, insects, and distant howler monkeys.</li>
</ul>

<p class="md-paragraph">
  Unlike tropical rainforests below, cloud forests feel more intimate. The trails are narrower, the views revealed slowly rather than all at once. Places like Monteverde reward patience — the longer you linger, the more the forest offers.

  “In the cloud forest, nothing demands your attention — it simply waits for you to notice.”

<p class="md-paragraph">
  Afternoons often disappeared into quiet moments: warm coffee grown on nearby slopes, conversations with local guides who knew every sound and shadow, watching clouds drift endlessly through the canopy. It wasn’t about doing more — it was about being present.
</p>

  Leaving the cloud forest felt less like departure and more like waking from a vivid dream. Costa Rica’s highlands don’t overwhelm you — they quietly reshape how you move, listen, and see. Long after the mist fades, the stillness stays with you.

  Some places are meant to be explored slowly. Costa Rica’s cloud forests are one of them.
