<p class="md-paragraph">
  <span class="md-first-letter">F</span>rance is a love story between food and culture. Each region brings its own flavor — buttery croissants, aged cheese, and sun-kissed wines. From Parisian cafés to seaside bistros, every meal is an invitation to savor life slowly.

<h4 class="md-section-title">Paris – The Art of Simplicity</h4>
<p class="md-paragraph">
  Begin your culinary tour in <b>Paris</b>, where breakfast starts with a fresh croissant from a local boulangerie. Pair it with café crème and people-watch as the city awakens. Visit the <b>Marché d’Aligre</b> for vibrant produce, cheeses, and charcuterie, or indulge in fine dining at Michelin-starred institutions.
</p>

<h4 class="md-section-title">Lyon – France’s Gastronomic Capital</h4>
<p class="md-paragraph">
  In <b>Lyon</b>, traditional <b>bouchons</b> serve comfort classics like quenelles, coq au vin, and praline tart. Here, the joy of eating is communal — shared between friends over local Beaujolais wine. Don’t miss the <b>Halles de Lyon Paul Bocuse</b>, a paradise for gourmets.

<h4 class="md-section-title">Provence – Sunshine on a Plate</h4>
<p class="md-paragraph">
  Travel south to <b>Provence</b>, where lavender fields meet olive groves. Meals here are colorful and fragrant: ratatouille, tapenade, and rosé wine under the summer sun. Local markets burst with tomatoes, herbs, and fresh baguettes — the definition of rustic perfection.
</p>

<h4 class="md-section-title">Brittany – Where the Sea Meets the Plate</h4>
<p class="md-paragraph">
  Along the rugged coast of <b>Brittany</b>, the air smells of salt and butter. Enjoy galettes filled with ham and cheese, and finish with salted caramel crêpes. Pair them with <b>cider</b> — the region’s beloved drink, traditionally served in ceramic cups.
</p>

<h4 class="md-section-title">Bordeaux – The Wine Heart of France</h4>
<p class="md-paragraph">
  End your journey in <b>Bordeaux</b>, where every meal comes with a story in a glass. Visit vineyards, taste regional cheeses, and dine al fresco near the Garonne River. Don’t leave without sampling canelés — small caramelized pastries that capture the essence of the city.
</p>

<p class="md-paragraph">
  Every region of France tells its own story through taste. Whether you’re sipping Champagne in Reims or sharing cheese in the Alps, one truth remains: the best way to know France is to eat your way through it.
